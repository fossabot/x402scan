## Monorepo Structure

This is a pnpm monorepo with the following workspaces:

- **scan/** - Next.js web application (x402scan.com)
- **sync/** - Background sync service using Trigger.dev
- **facilitators/** - Shared facilitator configuration

## Development

_Note: We're working on making this easier to spin-up. If you have any trouble in the mean time, please reach out._

Fill out a `.env.example` with the variables in `scan/.env.example`.

Then install and run:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run the frontend
pnpm dev

# Run the sync service
pnpm dev:sync
```

## Contributing

We're actively seeking contributors to help build x402scan. We believe an ecosystem explorer will shed light on the activities happening over x402, build trust, and help standardize interaction patterns to grow the ecosystem massively.

### Add Resources

If you know of a resource that is not yet listed, you can add it by visiting [https://www.x402scan.com/resources/register](https://www.x402scan.com/resources/register) and submitting the URL. If the URL returns a valid x402 schema, it will be added to the resources list automatically.

### Add Facilitators

If you know of another facilitator that is not listed, you can add it to [`facilitators/config.ts`](https://github.com/Merit-Systems/x402scan/blob/main/facilitators/config.ts) and the dashboard will automatically update.

To add a new facilitator:

1. Add the facilitator logo to `facilitators/images/`
2. Add the facilitator configuration to the `_FACILITATORS` array in `facilitators/config.ts`:

```typescript
{
  id: 'my-facilitator',
  name: 'My Facilitator',
  image: '/my-facilitator.png',
  link: 'https://my-facilitator.com',
  color: 'var(--color-blue-600)',
  addresses: {
    [Chain.BASE]: [
      {
        address: '0x...', // Your facilitator address
        token: USDC_BASE_TOKEN,
        syncStartDate: new Date('2025-01-01'),
        enabled: true,
      },
    ],
  },
}
```

3. Run `pnpm check:facilitators` to validate your changes
